                    <p>My name is Brittany Huber and I am a Product Support Specialist at RE/MAX, LLC. In this position I help RE/MAX agents with technical issues they experience with our products. The job involves troubleshooting, while also providing a great customer experience.</p>
                    <p>I am also currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Denver University in which I am learning valuable skills to become a web developer. Some of the topics we will cover are HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, MySQL, and others. In 6 months, after I have completed this course, I will be ready and excited to transition my career to the field of web development.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking, baking, doing makeup, and playing video games. I also have two cats, both of which are crazy, but adorable.</p>
